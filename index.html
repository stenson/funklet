<div id="about">
  <p>The Funklet?<p>
  <p>Every drummer on this website has great feel &mdash; duh. Beyond feel, they are also reat composers.</p>
  <p>Think of the drums set as a three key piano. Instead of strings, the hammers hit tubular wooden shells covered with stretched animal hides. Actually, just think of a drum set.</p>
  <p>These beats are clever melodic phrases that translate across different timbers. You can play &ldquo;Yesterday&rdquo; on the oboe. You can play &ldquo;Cold Sweat&rdquo; on an 808. Dig?</p>
  <p>If you are looking for more anecdotes and technical advice, check out Jim Payne&rsquo;s <em>The Drummers Some!</em> and Stanton Moore&rsquo;s <em>Groove Alchemy</em>, respectively.</p>
  <p>Enjoy the website. I enjoy making it. If you anything creative with the beats you find here, let me know.</p>
